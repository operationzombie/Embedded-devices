// Hello 2017 ENGR301/302 Project group
// As should have been made clear by the handover documentation
// we had to implement a quick workaround at the end of the project
// to reach our MVP.
// Consequently this is an archive of the old code before we 
// implemented the workaround and is purely for usbasp coding
// and the discrete, non arduino, ATMEL ATMega32a-pu controller

// Best wishes
// Operation Zombie 2016
